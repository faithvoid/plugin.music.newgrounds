# Newgrounds Audio
Basic Newgrounds Audio Portal client for XBMC.

[](/release/default.tbn)

Requires the latest version of XBMC (3.6-DEV-r33046 or later) from Xbins (as it has crucial TLS/SSL updates that allow this script to work).

## How To Use:
- Download latest release file.
- Extract the .zip file.
- Copy the "Newgrounds" folder to Q:/plugins/music
- Run the add-on and enjoy!

## Issues:
- Thumbnails are currently broken as Newgrounds uses .webp, which XBMC doesn't support.
- You tell me.

## TODO:
- Implement better filename sanitization.
- Incorporate update script(?)
- Clean up code.
